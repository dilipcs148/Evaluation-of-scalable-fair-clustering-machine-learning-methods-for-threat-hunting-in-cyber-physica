## Dataset
Dataset was obtained from cybersciencelab.org

In order to run the analysis of this research, please follow these quick instructions.

1. The jupyter notebook files BATADAL.ipynb,IoT_sourcecode.ipynb, IOT_unseen.ipynb, SWAT2015.ipynb are the main files in respective folders with our analysis and results.
2. Accuracy_fairtree.py and multi_cluster_accuracy_fairtree.py files are the modified code version of the source paper for accuracy calculation with different number of clusters in the respective folders.
3. The data files for SWAT2015 are not provided due to huge file size and can be generated from the SWAT2015.ipynb code.
Because of multiple changes some sections of the ipynb files may be dependent on another section of the same file and may need a little tweak while running fresh again.
